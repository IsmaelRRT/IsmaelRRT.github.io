# About Me
Hi, I am Ismael Rosero. I am a Finance student at Brigham Young University–Idaho with a minor in Business Analytics. I enjoy working with financial data, building tools that automate work, and creating clear insights from numbers.

This website is my Finance and Analytics Portfolio. Here you can find projects that I built using Excel, VBA, Python, R, Power BI, and Tableau. These include automated tools, financial models, and data dashboards. Each project shows how I like to work by organizing information, solving problems, and turning data into something useful.

I am interested in opportunities in financial analysis, risk, and data analytics. I want to use both my finance background and my technical skills in my future career. I am always learning and building new projects, and I look forward to growing in this field.
